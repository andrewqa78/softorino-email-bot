# Softorino Email Bot

Automated email support for a configurable Gmail mailbox, built as a Python 3.12 Vercel serverless function.

## Mailbox configuration

For testing, set `GMAIL_USER_EMAIL` to your personal Gmail address and authorize
that same account with Google OAuth. Do not use `support@softorino.app` until the
bot has been verified in draft-only mode.

When testing is complete, change only `GMAIL_USER_EMAIL` to:

```text
support@softorino.app
```

The OAuth credentials and refresh token must belong to the mailbox configured in
`GMAIL_USER_EMAIL`. Never commit them to GitHub.

## Project structure

Implementation setup will be added in the next steps:

1. Gmail API OAuth integration
2. GitHub knowledge base fetching
3. Claude API reply generation
4. Gmail reply and read-status handling
5. Vercel deployment configuration
