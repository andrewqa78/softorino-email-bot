"""Regression tests for the rule-based checks that run before Claude is called.

These two functions decide whether a customer ever gets a reply at all, and both
of them have already shipped a bug that silently swallowed real support mail:

* ``detect_escalation_triggers`` matched ``no support`` as a plain substring, so
  it fired inside our own company name -- ``Softori[no Suppor]t Team``. Every
  "Hello Softorino Support" and every quoted bot signature escalated with
  "Refund Request (Customer Refuses Help)" before ``generate_reply`` was reached,
  so the customer got nothing back.
* ``split_latest_message`` only knew English quote markers, so a Gmail account
  with a non-English interface left its attribution line -- company name and all
  -- inside the text treated as the customer's new message, feeding the bug
  above.

Both classes of failure are invisible in production: the run reports success and
the ticket just quietly becomes an escalation. Hence these tests.

The bot's third-party imports are stubbed out below, so this runs on a bare
Python 3.12 with nothing installed.

Usage::
